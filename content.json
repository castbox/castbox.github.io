He started The Solopreneur Hour Podcast in August 2013, and the show has about 8 million downloads as of Feb, 2017. Follow Michael on Twitter at @solohour. Notes Organized by Jocelyn, at CastBox Many people are launching their own podcasts nowadays. But as the number of downloads and subscribers begin to fade, the passion for podcasting can go as well. One of the most effective ways to market and promote your podcast is by interviewing an influencer and having him/her make a guest appearance on your show. However, the traditional style of a back-and-forth Q&amp;A probably wouldn’t attract lots of attention, and could even have a negative effect if people start associating your show with boring and loquacious lectures. So, the question becomes: How to become an interview master and how it can massively grow your podcast? In a session hosted by the Social Media Marketing World, Michael O’Neal has shared with us his strategies on how to ace interviews. Below are the notes we organized to share with all the podcasters out there who are currently struggling with their interviewing techniques. First, ask yourself: what is the goal of having a big influencer on your show? Having a specific target is always important before you go into any interview. Define your goal. Ask yourself: what is the most important thing you want to get out of this interview? Also remember: don’t just ask questions. It’s really not about the questions you ask; it’s about how your guests answer your questions and how they feel after the interview. Do they get anything out of being interviewed? Do they also think this could be an informational episode that they could share with their audiences as well? Have they doled out the most helpful experiences they could share? Would they want to do more interviews with you in the future? These are all questions you need to consider before you actually get into the interview if you want to establish long-term connections with your guests. Some people may wonder, even if I have my targeted audiences and outcome, where do I find the right person to interview? I’m a beginner in the podcasting industry, and there seems to be no way for me to connect with my ideal interviewing candidates. If you find yourself in this conundrum, don’t fret, as Michael suggests three places where you can score amazing guests: Events. Before you begin, you need to first know what your podcast’s topics, as well as what your episodes will be about in order to find the right events to attend to start building your network. Those events do not have to be podcast-related as long as they meet your needs. For example, someone is hosting a social media strategies-related podcast. What could be a useful sphere for them to look into? The Social Media Marketing World! Guests and speakers at these events are often very friendly and would love to speak to you, as that’s what they’re there for. So step out and find an event that you think is worth attending, and don’t be afraid to put yourself out there! 3rd Parties. There are lots of places that could help you find and make connections with the perfect guests. One such place is right before your eyes. Revisit your current network of connections and see if anyone within your circle can introduce you to the right people. Never underestimate the power of connections! Use the 6 Degrees of Separation to your advantage! Other Shows. This one’s a no-brainer. One of the best ways to discover hosts like yourself is to search for and listen to podcasts within your realm of interests. Find people who inspire you, podcasters who offer interesting content that you enjoy, and invite them to guest star in one of your podcasts. This is a great way to help each other gain more subscribers and broaden your sphere of influence. Great! Now that you’ve found the perfect guest, what kind of prep work should you do before conducting your interview? Do your homework and research your guest. Don’t just look at their “about me” section as everything there is probably too general or boring to include in your interview since everyone and their mother can easily find that information online. Make sure you pronounce your guest’s name correctly! Nothing says “I don’t know what I’m doing” like a mispronounced name. Also, keep an eye on their social media accounts. A lot of times, you can find interesting topics to discuss you’re your guests by simply scrolling through their feeds. Make sure everything is set up correctly for the interview. Are your devices ready to record? Have you prepared enough so your interview won’t be disrupted by outside factors? Gotta double check these details before you hit the ground running! What’s the most important thing your guests care about during your interview? For most of them, it’s the promotion factor! According to Michael, 85% of people who listen to podcasts don’t make it to the end of the show (yep that’s sad to hear, let’s pour one out for our fallen soldiers). SO, DON’T WAIT to promote your guest till the very end! Instead, promote him/her throughout the show. Make sure the promotion goes with the flow of your show and doesn’t sound awkward. After all, they are indeed doing you a favor. And always remember to Control the Interview! Do not let your guest take over at any time. Remember to always speak narratively, and always keep “community” in your mind. You can always start with the question “tell me the story of that time when…” which could lead to a great story the guest may have never talked to anyone about before. A great question Michael suggests that everyone can ask is the question of “difference”. For instance, what’s the difference between the new you and the old you? Would you have done something differently? These are always great leading questions for guest interviews. Michael also shared with us his all-time favorite question to ask his guests at the beginning of interviews: what did your childhood smell like? According to Michael, the creative types would start answering while the data-driven people would not really understand the question. Therefore, you could then decide which direction to steer your conversation based on the answers you get to that question. Last but not least, you must have your guests share your show to maximize the result. Don’t be shy. Be straightforward and ask your guest if he or she is willing to share your show with their audience. Once you have an on-site confirmation, don’t forget to email them later with a simple note saying “thank so much for promising to share the show.” Yep it’s tricky and may not come off as all that natural, but it always works! 80% of the people you come across are actually be willing to share the show, so remember to give out a trackable CTR for episodes or channel links, so you can calculate your results in the end. Finally, if you are a shy host, don’t be afraid to do a pre-scripted show! Practice makes perfect, so don’t be afraid to start with the basics.

The democratization of media via technology tools that are easy to access, operate and share has served a dual purpose. It has allowed more people than ever to share their perspective but it has concurrently made it harder for your message to be heard. Democratization of access does not always equate to democratization of audience. Larger media companies have the ability to consolidate resources and scale their impact. Though that is a compelling narrative it does not tell the entire story. Consolidated media often lacks an authentic viewpoint that deeply resonates with their audience. Studies have shown that while podcast, for the most part, are still fragmented there is an outsized percentage of listener loyalty. “Podcasting offers a level of engagement with audiences that is incomparable with other digital media.” — Tow Center for Digital Journalism, Columbia University, Dec ‘15 “Podcast audiences are devoted fans whose enthusiasm carries over to the sponsors of their favorite shows” — Anna Bager, SVP and GM, IAB The above quotes are representative of the tremendous opportunity to share your own voice. The power of your voice as personified by your podcast message and theme is a powerful asset in a medium that has yet to consolidate. 2 Dope Boys &amp; a Podcast, the culture/insights show I co-founded &amp; co-host with Michael Brooks exemplifies the power of voice. We have taken our singular expertise in cultural anthropology and fused it with our backgrounds to create a show that is uniquely relevant. Our voices are in sync with our listeners. Our listeners are our first responsibility and we know we have to speak directly to them in a way that engages them. Because our show exist in the culture space the trust we establish with listeners is even more valuable. In turn, that value can be transitioned to advertisers, brands and organizations but only IF (capitalized on purpose) they are willing to do the heavy lifting and understand our Cultural Prime Directive. The Cultural Prime Directive is our voice yelling through a megaphone at the top of a mountain. It is the philosophical anchor of the show. We developed the Cultural Prime Directive as a roadmap to both our anthropological work and our contextualization of cultural moments in the zeitgeist. The Cultural Prime Directive is a collection of principles and rationales that serve as a blueprint for both strategic and structural shifts in the culture. You can read more here, but it is comprised of four core tenants (1) Do No Harm (2) Reevaluate Your Time Horizon (3) Be Brave (4) Lead a Love Centered Revolution. Probe, explore and develop your voice. We have managed to do just that and it has empowered our show and our business far beyond what we could have imagined when we began this journey. Find your collaborators, your brothers and sisters in arms. We have a strong Crew that hold us down and add their flavor to what we do, amplifying and spreading all of our voices through the collective. Your voice is the most powerful tool you have so use it wisely and courageously. 2 Dope Boys is an insights/trend-focused podcast that uses the lens of culture to breakdown the issues of the day. We touch everything from music, pop culture, business (specifically branding + advertising), politics and our collective future.

You can also check out his podcast on CastBox at http://castbox.fm/p/id372723 - Hello, My name is Rian Smith and I am a a fellow podcaster who has a podcast on Castbox called “The Deep Dive Report”. The Deep Dive Report is a podcast to take listeners past the surface of sports and to help build a greater understanding of the business behind the game. The Deep Dive Report was launched August 22, 2016 and I would like to share some ideas and thoughts that can help current and future podcasters. Equipment — Below is what I am currently using for my podcast and this is very cost effective. Microphone — Audio-Technica’s ATR 2100-USB (http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/b8dd84773f83092c/index.html) — Great microphone for it’s price. Headphones — Audio-Technica’s ATH-M50x (http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/99aff89488ddd6b1/index.html) — Great studio headphones for the price! If you don’t believe me look at other reviews. Software Skype — most used application to conduct interviews or shows with one or more guests/hosts Ecamm — great tool for recording your phone calls or Skype calls. This is a must have in the podcast industry. GargeBand — it’s a very user friendly application if you have a Mac and also it’s very easy to record, edit, convert and compress different audio files. Audacity — my favorite podcast tool! This is the best tool to use to take out any kind of background noise if you’re recording with someone via phone, Skype, etc with noise reduction. This is also a great application to record and edit audio files if you do not have a Mac. Format of the Podcast (Questions to ask yourself…) Try to have an idea on how you would like to present your show (this is very tough). Decide how long do you want each episode to be… (my episodes range from 30–50 minutes). Do you want to have a weekly podcast or daily podcast? What kind of content can you deliver on a consistent basis? What is your demographic or audience you want to attract? Marketing I would recommend everyone to start out with sharing your podcast with friends and family first just to see who can give you constructive feedback. Social media is a must when advertising your podcast (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc). Whoever shows interest in your podcast first, try to connect with them and bring them along the journey so they can spread the word! I always try to repeat this to myself a thousand times when it comes to marketing….”Think Local first and then National”. Basically I always try to remind myself to focus on my core network of friends, family and listeners before I focus on expanding to far out. Recommended Podcasts John Lee Dumas is a pioneer of podcasting and I would recommend to everyone to check out his podcast “Entrepreneur on Fire”. He is known as a great resource for getting started in the podcast industry. His website is EOFIre.com. “Stuff You Should Know” is also a podcast I would highly recommend because it is so different and not reliable on guests or what’s current today. I hope this information helps and please let me know if you have any other questions and concerns!

The core focus of Podfest is on the Education, Collaboration and the PME Community! This year they are expanding their conference and adding tracks that will be featuring YouTubers, Conference Builders, Live Streaming, Blogging, Independent Filmmaking, and Online Community Building! Here is the personal touch from the organizer, Chris, of Podfest: “Here’s a little known fact…I was born deaf in my right ear and had many surgeries as a child to reconstruct what was not there. I have always identified with others who believe in their heart of hearts that anything is possible. As a kid I was always the underdog, but my belief in myself always helped me manifest everything I set out to accomplish. I identify with Podcasters and online content creators because, by and large, they have so many obstacles up against them and yet they have a burning desire that compels them to get their message out. This is why PME17 is not just a conference, but a family made up of fellow attendees that keep coming back year after year! If you are one of those unique individuals, then look no further because PME17 was created just for you!” When: Feb 23rd-25th, 2017 Where: Orlando, FL Cost: $319 — $367 at http://podfest.us/2017/tickets/ For more information, check out their website at http://podfest.us/2017/ 5.

You can simply listen to them by clicking on the name of the podcast. 1. Presidential “Leading up to Election Day 2016, The Washington Post’s Presidential podcast explores how each former American president reached office, made decisions, handled crises and redefined the role of commander-in-chief, starting with George Washington in week one and ending on week 44 with the president-elect. Hosted by Lillian Cunningham, the series features Pulitzer Prize-winning biographers like David McCullough and Washington Post journalists like Bob Woodward. New episodes are released on Sundays.” 2. Vox’s The Weeds “Everyone is always warning you not to get lost in the weeds. But not Vox’s Ezra Klein, Sarah Kliff, and Matthew Yglesias. They love the weeds. That’s where all the policy is. This is the podcast for people who follow politics because they love thinking about health care, economics, and zoning. It is not a podcast for people who like hearing talk about gaffes.” 3. FiveThirtyEight Elections “Nate Silver and the FiveThirtyEight team cover the 2016 election, tracking the issues and “game-changers” every week.” 4. Slate’s Political Gabfest “Voted “Favorite Political Podcast” by iTunes Listeners.

We are very thrilled to receive this great honor and recognition, and are definitely motivated and encouraged for achieving a even greater success in the near future!” — CastBox Team The presentations from all 12 startups are available on Youtube at https://goo.gl/J0qrMy; To make it more convenient to learn about CastBox, we’ve organized a summary of speech from our CEO, Xiaoyu Wang, at the presentation day. Why CastBoxWhile working at Google, our CEO and Co-Founder Xiaoyu, had always spent at least two hours a day on commute and jogging.

What is CastBoxAs audio reach has been multiplied by nowadays mobile internet boom, and will potentially be extended by other smart hardwares, Xiaoyu captured this opportunity, and invented the audio app, CastBox, which is not music limited, and offers updated content for different needs.

Close your curtains, turn off your lights, volume up your speakers, and make this one-in-a-year weekend unforgettable. CastBox has put together a list of TOP 10 horror films, from all over the world, to help you make this weekend even more special and remarkable. 10. Ringu (1998) Ringu, 1998, directed by Hideo Nakata Ruthlessly murdered by her father, the ghost of a seer’s daughter kills all those seven days after they watch the strange contents of a mysterious video tape, unless the viewer finds the escape clause. As one of the most classic Japanese horror films in history, Ringu is on the top lists for horror film recommendations. Unlike those bloody images and techniques American horror films usually use, traditional Japanese horror films tend to focus more on the sound effect combined with spiritually shocking plots. Ringu may seem very scary to watch; but when it gets to the end, you’d discover another side that touches the deepest of your heart. 9. A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) A Nightmare On Elm Street, 1984, directed by Wes Craven Several people are hunted by a cruel serial killer who kills his victims in their dreams. While the survivors are trying to find the reason for being chosen, the murderer won’t lose any chance to kill them as soon as they fall asleep. As the milestone of bloody R-rated films, the highlight of this film must be the inception the film creates for audiences. Unlike traditional murders, the film kills in people’s dreams, the most defenseless time of the day. Victims are either killed, or trapped. The background music also makes the film stands out from the crowd, especially for the use of the children’s song. The far away, yet near by voice of the child, makes you wonder, he/she may just be standing behind your back. 8. Carrie (1976)(2013) Carrie, 1976, directed by Brian De Palma (2013, directed by Kimberly Pierce) Carrie White, a shy, friendless 17 year-old girl who is sheltered by her domineering, religious mother, unleashes her telekinetic powers after being humiliated by her classmates at her senior prom. Based on Carrie written by Stephen King, the film not only became the pioneer of high school horror films, but also provided many ideas for modern horror films. The newer version acted by Chloe Moratz, cleverly uses the modern technology of after effects, thus creating a visual feast of horror for audiences. The older version, however, focuses more on the religious aspect, which then brings you to a deeper level of thinking afterwards. Both versions are highly recommended. 7. Case 39 (2009) Case 39, 2009, directed by Christian Alvart A social worker fights to save a girl from her abusive parents, only to discover that the situation is more dangerous than she ever expected. No ghost scenes. No monsters. No bloods. What makes the film special is the evil that lives in your heart. This evil’s name can be called jealousy, insecurity, selfishness… Be ready for psychological shocks, and be ready for the water scene… 6. The Conjuring 2 (2016) The Conjuring 2, 2016, directed by James Wan Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a malicious spirit. Most people are suspected about series horror films- it seems like the first one is always the best one; and the more it produces, the worse the series gets. However, horror film master James Wan surely did a spectacular job on his recent new horror film The Conjuring 2. Concise yet attracting and logical plot, unexpected jump scare, with a perfect blend of audio and visual effects, all help _The Conjuring 2 _stands out from modern horror films. James Wan’s films are always interesting to watch for the second time, as you’ll discover lots more details you might not have noticed before. 5. Oculus (2013) Oculus, 2013, directed by Mike Flanagan A woman tries to exonerate her brother, who was convicted of murder, by proving that the crime was committed by a supernatural phenomenon. The unexpected that captures audiences’ attention, for almost every film, is always a plot twist. In this film, right when you are still in the surprise or shock by a plot twist, another plot twist would be coming its way. When you just start to believe that something is real, the image would collapse and bring you back to the skeptical and emotional stage again. From the beginning until the end, all of the information you perceives seem real, yet they create an illusional circle and trap you in the center of it. You cannot stop questioning about yourself even after the film ends. And a great question to think of is, where’s the real oculus? 4. Kokuhaku “Confession” (2010) Confession, 2010, directed by Tetsuya Nakashima A psychological thriller of a grieving mother turned cold-blooded avenger with a twisty master plan to pay back those who were responsible for her daughter’s death. Extremely strong contrasting in both images and plots, from pure heaven to bloody hell, and an emphasis on the focus of to live or to die, are the most important elements of Japanese horror films. The film uses a very quiet and clean image tone, with soft and even a bit animated music, to elaborate a story about death and revenge. Lots of slow-motion scenes, emotionless faces, and dead silence all create a strong contrast with traditional horror film’s bloods, screams, and shocking faces. Sometimes, silence could be the scariest thing; the outcome of the sudden explosion of dead silence we are repressed in, could be destructive both psychologically, and physically. 3. Orphan (2009) Orphan, 2009, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra A husband and wife who recently lost their baby adopt a nine year-old girl who is not nearly as innocent as she claims to be. Orphan is more like in-between the category of horror and literary film because there seems to be no elements relating to the term “scary.” How could we link a 12-year-old girl to something thrilling? When our moral standards and sympathy got challenged again and again, we start to question, if our “standards” are just those “standards” we create on our own? The film is a bit Hitchcock style, making you worried and scared by any upcoming images it may appear on screen, just a nightmare becoming true. The huge plot twist in the end would also make you question the reality you are living in; those who live by your side, your closest friends and families, may also be hiding something from you. 2. Psycho (1960) Psycho, 1960, directed by Alfred Hitchcock A Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer’s client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. Nominated for 4 Oscars, and as a film produced in 1960, Psycho has not only gained its reputation among horror films, but can be seen as the pioneer of the whole film industry. The famous TV series Bates Motel, was based on the same story that happened in Psycho. If you want to get to know Hitchcock and how horror theme was filmed, you should start with Psycho. It first throws out a question for you to wonder; then distract your attention by making another question hanging there.It never ends with one simple plot twist, but one plot twist after one plot twist. Moreover, it never shows you the full image on screen but gives you the mise-en-scene by cinematographic techniques and audiences’ own imagination. Hitchcock was famous for his use of voyeurism, and you can definitely feel yourself being the “voyeur” inPsycho. So, if Psycho is a must seen film in life, why not watch it on the Halloween weekend? 1. The Shining (1980) The Shining, 1980, directed by Stanley Kubrick A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. DANG DANG DANG DANG! Here comes the last film we recommend, directed by Stanley Kubrick, produced in 1980, the famous horror film- the Shining. Watching horror films is like eating sleeping pills; the more you watch/eat, the less sensitive it gets. Even the classic horror film Exorcist, can be apply to this rule. The Shining, however, is an exception. The more times you watch, the scarier it gets. It gives the modern horror film world a brand new definition. It does not only create physical and mental shock; the scariness would go into your bones, and frighten your spirit The whole film is like a nightmare which makes you believe in the existence of the supernaturals. The plot, instead of being logical, turns out to be completely illogical on the chronicle order. Time is not continuous anymore, but travels in a circle, which does not make sense for us in the real world. Is it then, that everything happens in the film, would be a story out of a story? We don’t know. What we do know is, the more detailed you watch this film, the more surprises you will find.
