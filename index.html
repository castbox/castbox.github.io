<h2 id="Why-CastBox"><a href="#Why-CastBox" class="headerlink" title="Why CastBox"></a>Why CastBox</h2><p>While working at Google, our CEO and Co-Founder Xiaoyu, had always spent at least two hours a day on commute and jogging. To make good use of time, she had always listened to audio, including downloadable audiobooks, music, radios and podcasts. She therefore discovered this great opportunity in audio market, and found out from data that people spend an average of 95 minutes a day listening to audios from different devices.</p>
<p>“<em>I really wanted an app that could read my mind, know what I want to hear for different situations, seamlessly play my favorite episodes via different devices.</em>” said Xiaoyu, at the presentation on Google Demo Day.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-CastBox"><a href="#What-is-CastBox" class="headerlink" title="What is CastBox"></a>What is CastBox</h2><p>As audio reach has been multiplied by nowadays mobile internet boom, and will potentially be extended by other smart hardwares, Xiaoyu captured this opportunity, and invented the audio app, CastBox, which is not music limited, and offers updated content for different needs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IfZIXJ3vhL4k9h_K1HwNhA.png" alt="CastBox, a smart audio aggregation app"></p>

Moreover, all of the available audio content will be accessible via phones, cars, and smart home devices by simply using voice commands in the near future. Besides that, CastBox is also in the process of applying multiple monetization models, such as advertising, in-app purchase, and subscription.</p>

<p>10.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178868/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>Ringu</em></a> (1998)</p>
<p>Ringu, 1998, directed by Hideo Nakata</p>
<p>Ruthlessly murdered by her father, the ghost of a seer’s daughter kills all those seven days after they watch the strange contents of a mysterious video tape, unless the viewer finds the escape clause.</p>
<p>As one of the most classic Japanese horror films in history, <em>Ringu</em> is on the top lists for horror film recommendations. Unlike those bloody images and techniques American horror films usually use, traditional Japanese horror films tend to focus more on the sound effect combined with spiritually shocking plots. <em>Ringu</em> may seem very scary to watch; but when it gets to the end, you’d discover another side that touches the deepest of your heart.</p>

<p>9.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>A Nightmare On Elm Street </em></a>(1984)</p>
<p>A Nightmare On Elm Street, 1984, directed by Wes Craven</p>
<p>Several people are hunted by a cruel serial killer who kills his victims in their dreams. While the survivors are trying to find the reason for being chosen, the murderer won’t lose any chance to kill them as soon as they fall asleep.</p>
<p>As the milestone of bloody R-rated films, the highlight of this film must be the inception the film creates for audiences. Unlike traditional murders, the film kills in people’s dreams, the most defenseless time of the day. Victims are either killed, or trapped. The background music also makes the film stands out from the crowd, especially for the use of the children’s song. The far away, yet near by voice of the child, makes you wonder, he/she may just be standing behind your back.</p>

<p>8.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074285/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>Carrie</em></a> (1976)(2013)</p>
<p>Carrie, 1976, directed by Brian De Palma (2013, directed by Kimberly Pierce)</p>
<p>Carrie White, a shy, friendless 17 year-old girl who is sheltered by her domineering, religious mother, unleashes her telekinetic powers after being humiliated by her classmates at her senior prom.</p>
<p>Based on <em>Carrie</em> written by Stephen King, the film not only became the pioneer of high school horror films, but also provided many ideas for modern horror films. The newer version acted by Chloe Moratz, cleverly uses the modern technology of after effects, thus creating a visual feast of horror for audiences. The older version, however, focuses more on the religious aspect, which then brings you to a deeper level of thinking afterwards. Both versions are highly recommended.</p>

<p>7.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795351/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>Case 39</em></a> (2009)</p>
<p>Case 39, 2009, directed by Christian Alvart</p>
<p>A social worker fights to save a girl from her abusive parents, only to discover that the situation is more dangerous than she ever expected.</p>
<p>No ghost scenes. No monsters. No bloods. What makes the film special is the evil that lives in your heart. This evil’s name can be called jealousy, insecurity, selfishness… Be ready for psychological shocks, and be ready for the water scene…</p>

<p>6.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3065204/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>The Conjuring 2</em></a> (2016)</p>
<p>The Conjuring 2, 2016, directed by James Wan</p>
<p>Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a malicious spirit.</p>
<p>Most people are suspected about series horror films- it seems like the first one is always the best one; and the more it produces, the worse the series gets. However, horror film master James Wan surely did a spectacular job on his recent new horror film <em>The Conjuring 2</em>. Concise yet attracting and logical plot, unexpected jump scare, with a perfect blend of audio and visual effects, all help _The Conjuring 2 _stands out from modern horror films. James Wan’s films are always interesting to watch for the second time, as you’ll discover lots more details you might not have noticed before.</p>

<p>5.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>Oculus</em></a> (2013)</p>
<p>Oculus, 2013, directed by Mike Flanagan</p>
<p>A woman tries to exonerate her brother, who was convicted of murder, by proving that the crime was committed by a supernatural phenomenon.</p>
<p>The unexpected that captures audiences’ attention, for almost every film, is always a plot twist. In this film, right when you are still in the surprise or shock by a plot twist, another plot twist would be coming its way. When you just start to believe that something is real, the image would collapse and bring you back to the skeptical and emotional stage again. From the beginning until the end, all of the information you perceives seem real, yet they create an illusional circle and trap you in the center of it. You cannot stop questioning about yourself even after the film ends. And a great question to think of is, where’s the real oculus?</p>

<p>4.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1590089/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>Kokuhaku</em></a><em> “Confession”</em> (2010)</p>
<p>Confession, 2010, directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0620363?ref_=tt_ov_dr" target="_blank" rel="external">Tetsuya Nakashima</a></p>
<p>A psychological thriller of a grieving mother turned cold-blooded avenger with a twisty master plan to pay back those who were responsible for her daughter’s death.</p>
<p>Extremely strong contrasting in both images and plots, from pure heaven to bloody hell, and an emphasis on the focus of to live or to die, are the most important elements of Japanese horror films. The film uses a very quiet and clean image tone, with soft and even a bit animated music, to elaborate a story about death and revenge. Lots of slow-motion scenes, emotionless faces, and dead silence all create a strong contrast with traditional horror film’s bloods, screams, and shocking faces. Sometimes, silence could be the scariest thing; the outcome of the sudden explosion of dead silence we are repressed in, could be destructive both psychologically, and physically.</p>

<p>3.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1148204/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>Orphan</em></a> (2009)</p>
<p>Orphan, 2009, directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1429471?ref_=tt_ov_dr" target="_blank" rel="external">Jaume Collet-Serra</a></p>
<p>A husband and wife who recently lost their baby adopt a nine year-old girl who is not nearly as innocent as she claims to be.</p>
<p>Orphan is more like in-between the category of horror and literary film because there seems to be no elements relating to the term “scary.” How could we link a 12-year-old girl to something thrilling? When our moral standards and sympathy got challenged again and again, we start to question, if our “standards” are just those “standards” we create on our own? The film is a bit Hitchcock style, making you worried and scared by any upcoming images it may appear on screen, just a nightmare becoming true. The huge plot twist in the end would also make you question the reality you are living in; those who live by your side, your closest friends and families, may also be hiding something from you.</p>

<p>2.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>Psycho</em></a> (1960)</p>
<p>Psycho, 1960, directed by Alfred Hitchcock</p>
<p>A Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer’s client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother.</p>
<p>Nominated for 4 Oscars, and as a film produced in 1960, Psycho has not only gained its reputation among horror films, but can be seen as the pioneer of the whole film industry. The famous TV series Bates Motel, was based on the same story that happened in Psycho. If you want to get to know Hitchcock and how horror theme was filmed, you should start with Psycho. It first throws out a question for you to wonder; then distract your attention by making another question hanging there.It never ends with one simple plot twist, but one plot twist after one plot twist. Moreover, it never shows you the full image on screen but gives you the mise-en-scene by cinematographic techniques and audiences’ own imagination. Hitchcock was famous for his use of voyeurism, and you can definitely feel yourself being the “voyeur” in<em>Psycho</em>. So, if <em>Psycho</em> is a must seen film in life, why not watch it on the Halloween weekend?</p>

<p>1.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/" target="_blank" rel="external"> <em>The Shining</em></a> (1980)</p>
<p>The Shining, 1980, directed by Stanley Kubrick</p>
<p>A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future.</p>
<p>DANG DANG DANG DANG! Here comes the last film we recommend, directed by Stanley Kubrick, produced in 1980, the famous horror film- the Shining.</p>
<p>Watching horror films is like eating sleeping pills; the more you watch/eat, the less sensitive it gets. Even the classic horror film <em>Exorcist</em>, can be apply to this rule. <em>The Shining</em>, however, is an exception. The more times you watch, the scarier it gets. It gives the modern horror film world a brand new definition. It does not only create physical and mental shock; the scariness would go into your bones, and frighten your spirit The whole film is like a nightmare which makes you believe in the existence of the supernaturals.</p>
<p>The plot, instead of being logical, turns out to be completely illogical on the chronicle order. Time is not continuous anymore, but travels in a circle, which does not make sense for us in the real world. Is it then, that everything happens in the film, would be a story out of a story? We don’t know. What we do know is, the more detailed you watch this film, the more surprises you will find.</p>
