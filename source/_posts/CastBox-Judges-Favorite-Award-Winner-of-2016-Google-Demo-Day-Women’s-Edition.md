## Why CastBox

While working at Google, our CEO and Co-Founder Xiaoyu, had always spent at least two hours a day on commute and jogging. To make good use of time, she had always listened to audio, including downloadable audiobooks, music, radios and podcasts. She therefore discovered this great opportunity in audio market, and found out from data that people spend an average of 95 minutes a day listening to audios from different devices.

“_I really wanted an app that could read my mind, know what I want to hear for different situations, seamlessly play my favorite episodes via different devices._” said Xiaoyu, at the presentation on Google Demo Day.

## What is CastBox

As audio reach has been multiplied by nowadays mobile internet boom, and will potentially be extended by other smart hardwares, Xiaoyu captured this opportunity, and invented the audio app, CastBox, which is not music limited, and offers updated content for different needs.
