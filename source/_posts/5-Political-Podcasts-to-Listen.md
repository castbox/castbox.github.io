_“Leading up to Election Day 2016, The Washington Post’s Presidential podcast explores how each former American president reached office, made decisions, handled crises and redefined the role of commander-in-chief, starting with George Washington in week one and ending on week 44 with the president-elect. Hosted by Lillian Cunningham, the series features Pulitzer Prize-winning biographers like David McCullough and Washington Post journalists like Bob Woodward. New episodes are released on Sundays.”_

_“Everyone is always warning you not to get lost in the weeds. But not Vox’s Ezra Klein, Sarah Kliff, and Matthew Yglesias. They love the weeds. That’s where all the policy is. This is the podcast for people who follow politics because they love thinking about health care, economics, and zoning. It is not a podcast for people who like hearing talk about gaffes.”_

## 3.[ FiveThirtyEight Elections](http://castbox.fm/app/castbox/feed/cceeaeabdc0b83facfabcc9aed687219f60913fa)

_“Voted “Favorite Political Podcast” by iTunes Listeners. Stephen Colbert says “Everybody should listen to the Slate Political Gabfest.” The Gabfest, featuring Slate’s Emily Bazelon, John Dickerson, and David Plotz, is the kind of informal and irreverent discussion Washington journalists have after hours over drinks. Part of the Panoply Network.”_

## 5.[ Real Time With Bill Maher](http://castbox.fm/app/castbox/feed/b06504615a7c81d8265c5e631fb68f9980823ff6)
