Podcast Mid-Atlantic started (December 2014) as a Facebook group for podcasters who live in the Mid-Atlantic States (North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut). The idea was to bring podcasters together for meet ups, Google Hangouts and eventually grow into conferences. So, if you happen to be in the northeast are, and unfortunately cannot fly all the way to Cali, the Mid-Atlantic Podcast Conference should definitely be an event considering going to.

## 4. [Podfest](http://podfest.us/2017/)

Orlando, Florida is always a right place to go to! The core focus of Podfest is on the Education, Collaboration and the PME Community! This year they are expanding their conference and adding tracks that will be featuring YouTubers, Conference Builders, Live Streaming, Blogging, Independent Filmmaking, and Online Community Building!

Here is the personal touch from the organizer, Chris, of Podfest:

“_Here’s a little known fact…I was born deaf in my right ear and had many surgeries as a child to reconstruct what was not there. I have always identified with others who believe in their heart of hearts that anything is possible. As a kid I was always the underdog, but my belief in myself always helped me manifest everything I set out to accomplish. I identify with Podcasters and online content creators because, by and large, they have so many obstacles up against them and yet they have a burning desire that compels them to get their message out. This is why PME17 is not just a conference, but a family made up of fellow attendees that keep coming back year after year! If you are one of those unique individuals, then look no further because PME17 was created just for you!_”

When: Feb 23rd-25th, 2017

Where: Orlando, FL

Cost: $319 — $367 at [http://podfest.us/2017/tickets/](http://podfest.us/2017/tickets/)
